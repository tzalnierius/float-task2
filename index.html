                    <p>Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist,
                        theologian and one of the most influential men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
                        Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of
                        science.

                                equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
                                Physics “for his
                                services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the
                                photoelectric effect.
